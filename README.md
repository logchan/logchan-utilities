## logchan utilities

A somewhat useful Chrome extension

---

### Features

#### Pixiv Illustration Downloader

- Download illustrations, including *ugoira* (animations), from Pixiv
- Download together with metadata (.txt)
- Remembers what has been downloaded before
- Every link to a downloaded illustration is marked by adding a class *pixiv-dl-downloaded*. You can use user styles to highlight such links.
- Link marking is updated dynamically; downloading in one tab immediately marks every link in all opened tabs.

#### Twitter Picture Downloader

- Similar to the Pixiv one, without link marking

#### Copy Title and Url

- Context menu item to help sharing web pages

#### Miscellaneous

- Select a Pixiv illustration / author id and right-click to navigate to Pixiv
- Delete some browsing history by name (currently hard-coded)

### Usage

This extension will never appear in Chrome Extension Store. To use it, clone this repository and load unpacked extensions.

In this way, everyone can customize (e.g. filenames) and hot-fix (e.g. Pixiv layout change) it easily.

> Tired of Chrome's pop-up? Try other Chromium-based browsers instead! I use it on Vivaldi and it should work on Firefox as well.

### License

[DBAD license](https://dbad-license.org/). In particular, never upload it to the store.
